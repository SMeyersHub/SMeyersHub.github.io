# Project 1: PlayList Analyzer

* Author: Steven Meyers
* Class: CS121 Section 005
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This project prompts the user to input three song names, artists,
times, and file paths. It stores this data in 3 Song objects and
uses the data to calculate the average time, what song is closest
to four minutes, and make a list from the shortest song to the 
longest song.

## Compiling and Using

Compile this code by typing into your chosen console:
```
$javac PlayList.java
```
To run the compiled class, type:
```
$java PlayList
```
The program will then prompt you to enter a song title, artist, 
time, and file path three times in a row. After those inputs, no 
further interaction is required to get the output.
