## Overview

This project prints a menu and lets the user input a word/letter to select an option on the menu. It can perform functions such as load, search, analyze, print the file loaded, and reprint the menu. 

## Compiling and Using

Compile this code by typing into your chosen console:
```
$javac JukeboxHero.java
```
To run the compiled class, type:
```
$java JukeboxHero
```
The program will load up a menu and prompt the user to enter a
command. When the user enters a command (that is on the menu list),the program will prompt the user in other ways to lead them through that function, then return to the command input.
