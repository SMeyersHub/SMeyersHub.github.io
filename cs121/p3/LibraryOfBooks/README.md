* Author: Steven Meyers
* Class: CS121 Section 005
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This program has a class for a book and a library and allows the user to make a book and add them to a library through a driver class. The driver class allows the user to make a book, print the library, delete a book, read a book, and quit the program.

## Compiling and Using

To compile this project, type the following command into any command console you prefer:
```
$ javac *.java
``` 
or if you want to compile each class separately:
```
$ javac Book.java
```
& javac Library.java
```
$ javac LibraryOfBooks.java
```

Run the driver class with the command:
```
$ java LibraryOfBooks
```

A menu will appear and you can select an option by typing the first letter of the words (the letter in parenthesis).
