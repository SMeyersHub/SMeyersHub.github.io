# Project 4: Reader of Books

* Author: Steven Meyers
* Class: CS121 Section 005
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This program launches a GUI which allows the user to import a library from 
a CSV formatted file and then view the books in a text window. The viewer
allows the reader to navigate the book text by predefined pages.

## Compiling and Using
Compile this code by typing into your console of choice:
```
$javac ReaderOfBooks.java
```
To run the class after compiling, type:
```
$java ReaderOfBooks
```
The GUI will then pop up and the user can type their CSV library file
location into the text box, load it, and then chose the book they want
to read.
