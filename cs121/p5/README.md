# Project 5: Tic Tac Toe Game

* Author: Steven Meyers
* Class: CS121 Section 005
* Semester: Spring 2019

## Overview

This project has multiple running programs that can be launched. The TicTacToeGUI allows you to play the TicTacToeGame by simply clicking an area in the grid and repeating after the computer makes its move. A new game can be launched by hitting the new game button. The other program that is available for use is the TicTacToeTester which just simply runs and tests how the TicTacToeGame runs.

## Compiling and Using

This project has multiple files to run. Two ways can be done to compile the GUI and its code.
The first way can be done by typing this into console:
```
$javac TicTacToeGame.java
```
$javac TicTacToeGUI.java
```
$java TicTacToeGUI
```
This method will allow you to play a game in the GUI. This can be done simply by clicking an area on the grid and repeating after the computer moves. The easiest way to run the tester is:
```
$javac *.java
```
$java TicTacToeTester
```

The tester will automatically run and state the percentage which the code passes.
