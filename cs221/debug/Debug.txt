Debugging ArraySet.java

Bug #1:
    -What's the name of failed test? 
	testIsEmpty
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	Line 58 in TestSimpleSet_1.java
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found? 
	ArraySet.java line 40.
    -What did you do to fix it? 
	I set rear to equal 0 when isEmpty instead of greater than 0 since rear is also used as the
	size of the set, so when it is 0, the array must be empty.

Bug #2:
    -What's the name of failed test?
	intializeSet
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	Line 29 in TestSimpleSet_2
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found? 
	ArraySet.java line 60
    -What did you do to fix it? 
	I added a rear++ to the add method so that whenever something was added into rear, the 
	value of rear went up by 1 so that rear wouldn't be 0 by the time it hit the remove method and 
	the remove method could operate correctly instead of skipping to false when i = 0 and 
	rear = 0.

Bug #3:
    -What's the name of failed test?
	testRemove_validElements
    -Where (line number) did you place breakpoint(s)? 
	115 in TestSimpleSet_6
    -Where (line number) was the bug was found? 
	78 in ArraySet.java
    -What did you do to fix it? 
	I made the while statement be (i < rear - 1) so that it wouldnt go out of bounds and set 
	off an ArrayIndexOutofBounds error.
