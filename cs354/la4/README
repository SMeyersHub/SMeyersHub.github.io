# Language Assignment 4: AWK CSV to HTML

* Author: Steven Meyers
* Class: CS354 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2020

## Overview

This script is made in AWK to read from specific formatted CSV files that
include information about housing. This script pulls out the single family
dwellings and formats a website showing information on them in a table format.

## Compiling and Using

To use this code, the csvtohtml.awk file should be executable. This means that
you should be able to write:
```
./csvtohtml.awk < [CSV FILE].csv > [HTML FILE].html
```
where [CSV FILE] is the particular formatted CSV file and [HTML FILE] is the name of the
html file you want the awk script to write too. If this does not work, you can use gawk on
onyx to run the script as well.
```
gawk -f csvtohtml.awk < [CSV FILE].csv > [HTML FILE].html
```
